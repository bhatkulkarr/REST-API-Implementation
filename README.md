# RESTFul-API_Implementation
This project is all about implementation of RESTFul API.
In this is project I had implemented simple API using RESTFul API architecture,
it shows you how to make our own RESTFul API's.

Note: This project will not contain any GUI, please make use of postman to make request
to API.

Step 01: Look into code, carefully note down all tag names.
Step 02: Install Postman.
Step 03: Make sure your database is ready.
(Note: In this project I am using MongoDB with Mongoose).
Step 04: Make request to tag names, which you have notice in step 01 from postman.
